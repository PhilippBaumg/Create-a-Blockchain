Python Blockchain Project
Project Overview:
Welcome to our Python Blockchain Project! This repository is dedicated to a fully functional blockchain built from scratch using Python. Our aim is to provide a clear and concise implementation of blockchain technology that is easy to understand, yet robust in its functionality.

Key Features:

Custom Blockchain Implementation: We have created a blockchain protocol, including creating blocks, validating chain integrity, and implementing consensus algorithms.
Transaction Handling: The project includes a basic transaction system where users can send and receive tokens within the blockchain.
Proof of Work (PoW) Algorithm: We have implemented a PoW algorithm to secure the network and validate new blocks.
Decentralization: The network operates on a peer-to-peer architecture, emphasizing the decentralized nature of blockchain technology.
Smart Contract Functionality: A simple implementation of smart contracts that can be executed within the blockchain.
Python-Focused: Entirely written in Python, making it accessible for Python developers and those interested in blockchain development.
Technologies Used:

Language: Python
Libraries: Flask (for API creation), Requests (for network communication)
Getting Started:
To get started with this project:

Clone the repository
